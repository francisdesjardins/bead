## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- The Bead specification, `spec/spec.md`, for layout `0xA1`: the prefix, kinds, flags and blocks,
  reading an envelope, failures and the protocol's codes, calls and answers, cancel and
  reservation, subscriptions and pacing, transfers, sessions, relays and transports.
- The conformance files both implementations play: `spec/vectors.json` (123 vectors in 9 groups),
  `spec/conversations.json` (72 conversations) and `spec/interop-service.json`, with the generators
  that write them, `spec/generators/make_vectors.py` and `spec/generators/make_conversations.py`.
- The TypeScript implementation, `@francisdesjardins/bead`, in `implementations/typescript`: the
  WebSocket, HTTP and Web Worker transports, each a client and a server; the client and server
  routers; the service, session and notification managers; the client and server facades; gauges
  and health; and its interop server.
- The C# implementation, in `implementations/dotnet`: `Bead.Core`, `Bead.Transport.WebSockets`
  and `Bead.Transport.Http`, at behavioural parity with the TypeScript side, with its interop
  service and server.
- Interop both ways, over WebSocket and HTTP: the C# client against the TypeScript server and the
  TypeScript client against the C# server, required in CI by `BEAD_INTEROP_REQUIRED=1`.
- The demo, `yarn demo`, and its static build for a playground, `yarn playground:build:file`.
- `docs/decisions/`: the decision records, 0001 to 0009, and their index.
- `docs/support.md`: the support matrix, each feature in each language with the test that holds it,
  and the differences between the implementations.
- `tools/check-commits.mjs`, which holds every commit subject to Conventional Commits.
- `tools/coverage-report.mjs`, a local command: it merges the TypeScript side's istanbul report and
  the C# side's cobertura reports, and prints what the tests leave unrun, file by file.
- CI, on a pinned runner image, `ubuntu-26.04`: `spec`, `typescript` on Node 26 and on the floor,
  24, `dotnet`, `commits`, and `ci-ok`, the one required check. `typescript` also builds the demo's
  static playground and holds the root's files to the formatter.
- `.githooks/`, opt-in with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`: the Conventional Commits check
  over each message, and the checks a clone keeps for itself in `.claude/local/`, when it has them.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/workflows/`: the standing instructions for Claude sessions, and their
  workflows.
- The licence, Apache-2.0.
